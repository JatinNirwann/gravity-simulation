# Gravity Simulation  

## âš¡ Planned Work  
- Developing a **gravity simulation** using C++ and OpenGL.  
- Implementing **real-time physics calculations** for object interactions.  
- Using **OpenGL for rendering** in 2D/3D space.  
- Making the simulation **expandable** for more physics concepts.  
- Setting up **CMake and vcpkg** for dependency management.  

## Project Status  
This project is still in the early stages. Contributions and feedback are welcome!  

## Requirements (Planned)  
- C++  
- OpenGL  
- CMake  
- vcpkg (for managing dependencies)  

## Build Instructions (Planned)  
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/path/to/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build .

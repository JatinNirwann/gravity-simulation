# gravity-simulation

## This project is still in development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!


This is an ongoing project for simulating gravity using C++ and OpenGL. The simulation aims to visualize gravitational interactions between objects in a 2D/3D space.

## Features (Planned & Implemented)
- Real-time physics simulation
- OpenGL-based rendering
- Basic object interactions
- Expandable to include more physics concepts

## Requirements
- C++
- OpenGL
- CMake
- vcpkg (for managing dependencies)

## Build Instructions
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/path/to/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build .
```
